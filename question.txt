You are an expert data analyst agent. Your task is to scrape and analyze data from Wikipedia.
The source URL is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

You will generate robust Python code to perform this task. Pay close attention to data cleaning:
1.  Use pandas `read_html` to get the main data table.
2.  **Data Cleaning (Very Important):**
    *   For the 'Worldwide gross' column, you MUST remove the '$' symbol, commas ',', and correctly handle text like 'billion' or 'million'. Convert the final value to a numeric float or integer.
    *   For the 'Year', 'Rank', and 'Peak' columns, ensure they are also converted to clean numeric types.
3.  After cleaning the data, answer the following four questions.

The questions to answer are:
1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?
3. What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak columns?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak with a dotted red regression line. Return it as a base-64 encoded data URI.

CRITICAL FINAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTION:
Your response must be ONLY a single JSON array containing the four answers in order. The format must be `[number, string, number, string]`.
Example: [1, "Titanic", 0.485782, "data:image/png;base64,..."]
